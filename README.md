### Thanks
Thanks to Francis Garcia, a professor at the IUT of Montpellier-SÃ¨te, for accepting my end-of-module project idea and enabling me to carry it out. I'm grateful for his continuous critical feedback throughout the development, offering improvement suggestions, and highlighting the strong aspects of my project.
Also, thank you for teaching me that a proper backup is a very complex task, involving both security demands and the implementation of numerous mechanisms.
